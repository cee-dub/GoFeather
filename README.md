[GoFeather][homepage] is a package to provide [Go][golang] syntax support for [Sublime Text 2][st2].

It is an alternative to the stock package and differs in that it:

* Targets the language as of its [official stable release][go1] in 2012.
* Keeps the scope taxonomy simpler.

For GoFeather to be picked up by Sublime, you must first add the stock package ("Go") to the `ignored_packages` array in your settings file.
